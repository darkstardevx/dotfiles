Jun 08 17:35:09 <mattfly>	btw i screwed up something else.... Since i installed arch i never got my locale to work fine. I want to have en_US utf8 and pt_BR as a fallback langauge or secondary (i forgot the right term for this now). I have uncomented those lines from /etc/locale.gen and ran locale-gen but im getting lines like bsdtar: Failed to set default locale ,  /bin/bash: warning: setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (en_US)   all the time

Jun 08 22:29:56 <daffy1234>	theoretically yes but im not sure where it'd be. I'd recommend git cloning the AUR package and makepkg'ing it directly. That'll leave you with a nice .tar.zst to deal with

Jun 08 22:31:29 <talkinghead>	Yeah, hmm. I guess I might try to find what yay left over if I can, or try that otherwise. It's a fork of chromium, so when I compiled on my desktop overnight it was still going in the morning.

Currently I have KMS enabled, the --my-next-gpu-wont-be-nvidia flag on. When I run sway, my CPU usage goes really high and there's constant freezing and stuttering. If I run say from i3, the stuttering goes away. I'm wondering if there's a way to launch sway with xorg backend so it works as if it was launched inside

Jun 09 00:50:09 <lord4163>	mkoskar: maybe it's a bug.
Jun 09 00:50:49 <ayekat>	lord4163: dmenu passes the command to a shell as is - so if you want to use spaces in a command, you'll have to quote it
Jun 09 00:51:09 *	geowiesnot has quit (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
Jun 09 00:51:11 <ayekat>	the problem is that dmenu (probably?) presents you the command without quotes... so I guess there's a bit of an issue
Jun 09 00:51:25 <ayekat>	(then again, who in the World has a command with spaces in it...?)
Jun 09 00:51:57 <lord4163>	Well, the program or game has spaces in it :) But I can live without the spaces

Jun 09 04:44:43 <n00b101>	I currently have Win10,Arch dualboot. I want to install one more arch. So, 3 OSs.when I install 3rd arch, I mount /dev/efi to /efi/boot , Will it replace my grub in 2nd arch install?
Jun 09 04:44:43 <n00b101>	So, will it replace old grub with new grub (3rd arch's grub)? Or, do I need to install grub in 3rd install?
Jun 09 04:44:43 <n00b101>	 I believe, I'll just install arch normally thinking as dualboot. But, don't install grub? Because, this grub with replace my existing grub?
Jun 09 04:45:11 <Namarrgon>	don't install a second copy of grub, use the one you already have
Jun 09 04:45:50 <Namarrgon>	if you would want to install a second copy of grub, for whatever reason, you would give it a different --bootloader-id

Jun 09 06:31:03 <cdown>	I guess the summary is that people depend on network-online.target for network filesystems which are contingent on network access, but these are automount units -- the existence of the unit itself isn't contingent on that

Jun 09 06:31:53 <cdown>	However, people (understandably) add it because they don't understand the internals of automount units. I can empathise with that, but aside from saying "don't do that", I'm not sure what we should document
Jun 09 06:32:24 <cdown>	We generally try to avoid those kinds of comments in documentation, and stick just to the facts, since it's impossible to work out what people may or may not do
Jun 09 06:32:55 <cdown>	Maybe I can write something emphasising that these are After=/Requires= for the automount, which are not the same as After=/Requires= for the actual target itself
Jun 09 06:32:58 <NoImNotNineVolt>	automounting an nfs share has been painful for me.

Jun 09 07:44:34 <castleguard>	Is it common for people to run into problems after apparently installing correctly? The live environment (usb, .iso) works great, the installation is fine, but afterwards when I run ip it shows firmware that isn't there... i.e. it shows broadcom something or other rather than wlan0 as an intel wifi chip.
Jun 09 07:44:49 <castleguard>	(also uses a different name for it than wlan0)

Jun 09 07:45:36 <castleguard>	But I'm curious if it's common for people to say, "I thought this was working, then I rebooted."
Jun 09 07:46:05 <MacGyver>	It used to be very common, because wpa_supplicant was always forgotten.

Jun 09 12:29:13 <colwem>	I have i3, I seem to be getting desktop notifications from chrome (I believe). I seem to have libnotify installed but I do not appear to have any of the notification servers listed in this wiki entry https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Desktop_notifications.  So how am I getting notification popups?

Jun 09 12:30:55 <grawity>	if the popups are white background and in the corner, they're literally just mini Chrome windows
Jun 09 12:31:02 <colwem>	So if I install a native service it will use that instead?  So my solution is to install one and configure that?

Jun 09 13:02:03 <jadelclemens>	Hey all, I'm installing Arch in a VM (VMWare) for my job and have a small problem with Sway. Mousing over the bar - swaybar or waybar, doesn't matter - causes the cursor to disappear permanently.
Jun 09 13:02:09 <jadelclemens>	Anyone run into this before?
Jun 09 13:02:13 <beardoof>	there doesn't seem to be anything about discord crashes or core dumps there. I'm always skeptical if I should report bugs because it's most probably my fault / some change I did that made something stop working lol
Jun 09 13:02:53 <NetSysFire>	beardoof: first of all, ensure that you are viewing all projects. theres a small little box in the upper left that should say "Arch Linux", change that to "All Projects" and search again

Jun 09 13:59:33 <NetSysFire>	HS1: chromium has a data dir in your home dir
Jun 09 13:59:36 <thurstylark>	HS1: I'm not exactly sure either, but here's google's start page for crashes: https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/6271277?hl=en
Jun 09 13:59:37 <phrik>	Title: Troubleshoot Chrome crashes - Google Chrome Enterprise Help (at support.google.com)
Jun 09 13:59:55 <thurstylark>	I'd start by getting those logs and seeing if they're enlightening at all
Jun 09 14:00:02 <NetSysFire>	removing that may fix your issue but it will delete everything, so read the google docs first

Jun 09 14:00:55 <thurstylark>	oh sweet, the instructions on retrieving the debug log also has info about what to look for
Jun 09 14:00:57 <thurstylark>	neato
Jun 09 14:01:30 <HS1>	yeah I tried deleting the chromium folder in /.config and that didn't resolve the issue
Jun 09 14:02:01 <NetSysFire>	did you try creating another user and running chromium as this new user? if the issue persists its systemwide
Jun 09 14:02:31 <demonicm1niac1>	HS1: you might want to also delete ~/.cache/chromium
Jun 09 14:02:50 <haagch>	if the actual tab process crashes, there might be a coredump in coredumpctl
Jun 09 14:03:10 <haagch>	also about:crashes
